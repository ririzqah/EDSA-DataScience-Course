    "- **Do not add or remove cells in this notebook. Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will lead to a mark of 0%!**\n",
    "- Answer the questions according to the specifications provided.\n",
    "- Use the given cell in each question to to see if your function matches the expected outputs.\n",
    "- Do not hard-code answers to the questions.\n",
    "- The use of stackoverflow, google, and other online tools are permitted. However, copying fellow student's code is not permissible and is considered a breach of the Honour code below. Doing this will result in a mark of 0%.\n",

    "Proteins are the building blocks of life. The process starts when another protein (a polymerase) reads your genetic code and performs transcription, the code (RNA) for making protein. Ribosomes will then attach to this RNA code to begin making specific proteins. Your genetic code is made up of pairs of nucleotides. Once transcribed into the code, these nucleotides contain the following nucleotides:\n",
    "\n",
    "U,G,A,C.\n",
    "\n",
    "UGA, UAA, and UAG are stop codons and AUG is a start codon so that the protein ,ribosome, can identify where to stop and start the protein formation.\n",
    " \n",
    "A genetics lab has tasked you to design a function which recognises the length of the RNA code (excluding the start and stop codons). The function must also determine if there code is actually a valid piece of code (must contain AUG as a start codon and UGA, UAA, or UAG at the end).\n",
